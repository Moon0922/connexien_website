                Introduction</h6>
            <p>
                Connexien’s technology delivers highly skilled business talent and innovative workforce
                solutions to the world of financial services and its leading companies. While our
                technology provides unique opportunities to businesses as well as service providers,
                consultants, experts and specialists, the success of every engagement is predicated
                on the behavior of the people involved.
            </p>
            <p>
                Connexien’s Terms of Service specify the baseline legal guidelines of participating
                in the Connexien platform, and incorporate this Code of Conduct by reference, which
                is a document designed to ensure a shared standard for engagement through the platform
                and an alignment between Connexien and its users. In accordance with the Terms of
                Service, users who diverge from this Code may be barred from using Connexien either
                temporarily or permanently, depending on the seriousness of the breach. Connexien
                will update this policy regularly, though there may be unforeseen situations leading
                to account deactivation that are not listed in this policy.
            </p>
            <h6 class="page-header">
                Professionalism and Quality</h6>
            <p>
                Service providers, consultants, experts and specialists using Connexien should expect
                correspondence to be delivered by clients professionally and in good faith. Similarly,
                Connexien’s clients should expect to engage with experts producing high-quality
                work. Maintaining a high standard for platform engagement leads to better outcomes
                and more opportunities for clients and experts to engage. In addition to potential
                account deactivation causes set forth in the Terms of Service, Connexien reserves
                the right to deactivate accounts according to the following quality guidelines:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>If a user receives two or more ratings that are below two stars, their account may
                    be temporarily suspended pending further review.</li>
                <li>If Connexien receives one or more complaints about a user, Connexien may temporarily
                    suspend the user’s account pending further review. These complaints need not be
                    limited to the duration of a launched project.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                For details on the review process, please see the Mediation Processes and Procedures
                section at the end of this document.</p>
            <h6 class="page-header">
                Project Compliance</h6>
            <p>
                Projects sourced through Connexien must be set up, launched, and completed through
                the Connexien platform, in accordance with the Terms of Service and the disintermediation
                policy set forth therein.
            </p>
            <h6 class="page-header">
                Fraud and Misrepresentation</h6>
            <p>
                Fraudulent activity undermines the trust on which Connexien is built. Connexien
                expects all users to adhere to the following guidelines and will permanently deactivate
                any account associated with fraudulent activity. Specifically:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>All information on a user’s profile must be true and accurate. Users agree to provide
                    Connexien with accurate and complete biographical information, including job status
                    and employment history, and to promptly update that information as it changes. Connexien
                    may verify information provided by or about a user. If requested, users must assist
                    Connexien in this process.</li>
                <li>Experts bidding on projects must fully disclose the resources responsible for completing
                    project work. Any change in resources must be disclosed to the client as soon as
                    possible, even if there is no change in total project cost.</li>
                <li>Clients posting projects must fully disclose context that is relevant and critical
                    to an expert’s ability to successfully complete a project.</li>
                <li>Project work must not include misrepresentation or fraudulent creation of data.
                    The expert is required to disclose any sources used for project work upon request
                    from the client or Connexien.</li>
            </ul>
            <h6 class="page-header">
                Discrimination and Inappropriate Behavior
            </h6>
            <p>
                Connexien maintains a zero-tolerance policy regarding all forms of discrimination,
                harassment, or abuse. In particular, it is unacceptable to refuse to provide or
                accept services based on a person’s race, religion, national origin, disability,
                sexual orientation, sex, marital status, gender identity, age or any other characteristic
                protected under applicable federal or state law.
            </p>
            <p>
                All reports of inappropriate and/or discriminatory behavior are taken very seriously
                and will result in permanent loss of access to the Connexien platform. If you feel
                that you have been inappropriately targeted by another user, please reach out to
                <a href="mailto:info@Connexien.com">info@Connexien.com</a>.

            <h6 class="page-header">
                Mediation Processes and Procedures</h6>
            <p>
                In the event a complaint or incident arises between users on the platform, Connexien
                has a team ready to assist in the resolution of these matters in a fair and timely
                manner. Connexien’s team will address reported complaints and incidents in the following
                way:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Initiate investigation, including individual conversations with all users involved
                    in the complaint;</li>
                <li>Review all project-related data and correspondence captured on the platform and
                    gathered through conversations with involved parties;</li>
                <li>Coordinate mediation between the users involved in the complaint or incident;</li>
                <li>Make determination for appropriate mediation outcome(s), which may include user
                    deactivation, partial payment, refund of funds exchanged, and/or project re-staffing;</li>
                <li>Communicate determination to all involved parties via email; and</li>
                <li>Promptly carry out mediation outcome actions.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Connexien expects all users of the platform to cooperate with any investigations
                or other activities by Connexien in furtherance of the above procedures. As an outcome
                of mediation, Connexien may terminate or suspend a user’s right to use the Connexien
                platform. Termination or suspension will be effective immediately.
            </p>
            <p>
                If Connexien terminates or suspends a user’s Connexien account, the user is prohibited
                from creating a new account under their name, a fake or borrowed name, or the name
                of any third party, even if they are acting on behalf of the third party. In addition
                to terminating or suspending a user’s account, Connexien reserves the right to take
                appropriate legal action, including without limitation pursuing civil, criminal,
                and injunctive redress.
            </p>
            <p>

                <li>In the course of using the Platform (whether as a Client or Contractor), we may
                    ask you to provide us with, or grant us access to, or permission to obtain, certain

                    your date of birth, place of birth or taxpayer identification number. We may request
                    documents to verify this information, such as a copy of your government-issued identification
                    or photo, and we may authenticate it against third party databases or request a
                    credit report.</li>
                <li>As further described in our Terms of Service, you may register or input data onto
                    our Platform directly via the Site or by logging into your account with certain
                    third party social networking services (including, but not limited to, LinkedIn
                    or Facebook) ("SNS") via our Site. If you choose to input data via an SNS, we will
                    use the Personal Information you have provided to the SNS (such as your "real" name,
                    email address, gender, prior experience and other information you make publicly
                    available via the SNS) to modify and update your account; the information we extract
                    may depend on the privacy settings you have with the SNS. Other than what we may
                    share with the SNS as described below, the Personal Information an SNS has about
                    you is obtained by the SNS independent of our Platform, and Connexien is not responsible
                    for its accuracy, legality, or non-infringement.</li>
                <li>You may link your Connexien account to your SNS account, in which case the SNS may
                    share certain information about you with other SNS users, as well as sharing certain
                    information about other SNS users with you. You represent that you are authorized
                    to use your SNS account for the purposes described herein without breach by you
                    of any of the terms and conditions that govern the SNS, and without obligating Connexien
                    to pay any fees or making Connexien subject to any usage limitations imposed by
                    such SNS. You can disable the link between your Connexien account and your SNS account
                    at any time though the "Settings" section of the Site. PLEASE NOTE THAT YOUR RELATIONSHIP
                    WITH ANY SNS IS GOVERNED SOLELY BY YOUR AGREEMENT(S) WITH SUCH SNS. If your SNS
                    account terminates, then functions enabled through the link between your Connexien
                    account and your SNS account will terminate as well.</li>
                <li>We also collect other information that you provide in connection with your use of
                    the Platform (e.g., zip code (on its own) and individual preferences) ("Non-Identifying
                    Information"). We collect additional Non-Identifying Information from Clients in
                    the form of information related to jobs posted via the Platform (e.g., budget, location,
                    history of job listings, timing of job performance and feedback/rating information).
                    We also collect additional Non-Identifying Information from Contractors in connection
                    with Contractor profiles (e.g., information on jobs previously performed, skills,
                    tests taken, hourly pay rates and feedback/rating information).</li>
                <li>We use your Personal Information (in some cases, in conjunction with your Non-Identifying
                    Information) mainly to provide the Platform, complete your transactions, and administer
                    your inquiries.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Certain Non-Identifying Information would be considered a part of your Personal
                Information if it were combined with other identifiers (for example, combining your
                zip code with your street address) in a way that enables you to be identified. But
                the same pieces of information are considered Non-Identifying Information when they
                are taken alone or combined only with other non-identifying information (for example,
                your viewing preferences). We may combine your Personal Information with Non-Identifying
                Information and aggregate it with information collected from other Connexien Users
                to attempt to provide you with a better experience, to improve the quality and value
                of the Platform, and to analyze and understand how our Site and Platform are used,
                and to generate general industry analysis. We may also use the combined information
                without aggregating it to serve you specifically, for instance to deliver a product
                to you according to your preferences or restrictions.
            </p>
            <p>
                When you register for the Platform, you will be opting-in to receive Connexien emails,
                newsletters, marketing and/or promotional materials. We will also use your Personal
                Information to send this content to you. If you decide at any time that you no longer
                wish to receive such communications from us, you can opt-out or customize the type
                of messages you receive from Connexien by visiting the "Notifications" section under
                "Account Settings", or by clicking on the unsubscribe link included at the bottom
                of Connexien emails, or by emailing us at info@Connexien.com. Please note that any
                such opt-out applies solely to marketing related emails. Connexien will still need
                to communicate with you via email with regarding non-marketing related matters related
                to the Platform and you acknowledge and agree that Connexien has the right to do
                so.

                Two things drive Connexien’s decisions regarding the use of information collected
                from users: 1) improving user experience by offering personalized services, content
                and advertising, and 2) market research.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ads are a standard part of user experience on the Internet, and Connexien believes
                that targeted advertising enhances this experience. Connexien may use Cookies (defined
                below) and other technologies and Personal Information to place ads where they believe
                interested parties will see them. In addition to banner ads, Connexien may advertise
                products, companies and events that we think might interest you through the email
                address you provide.

                Connexien uses data at the individual level to sell products and services to Users
                who express an interest in these products and services, through a poll for example,

                Platform. The fees Connexien collects from Contractors are displayed to Contractors
                when they submit a bid on a project. The fees Connexien collects from Clients are
                built into the overall bid amounts displayed to Clients when reviewing bids.
            </p>
            <p>
                Clients and Contractors are required to make and receive all payments relating to,
                or in any way connected with, a Service Contract through the Connexien Platform.
                Any action that encourages or solicits complete or partial payment outside of the
                Connexien Platform is a violation of the Connexien Terms of Service. For additional
                details about this disintermediation policy, please refer to Section 3.5 of the
                Terms of Service.

                Any business user who is registered with Connexien can refer a friend. You do not
                need to have ever completed a project on Connexien to refer a friend. We refer to
                the person receiving a referral code as your referral. Referral codes should only
                be used for personal and non-commercial purposes. This means that you can share
                your invite link with your personal connections via email, Twitter, Facebook, and
                personal blogs. You agree not to publish or distribute the link, or cause the link
                to be published or distributed, on or via methods, platforms and media where you
                have no reasonable basis for believing that all or most of the readers or recipients
                are your personal friends (such as coupon websites, Reddit, Wikipedia).

                We can update these terms at any time without prior notice. If we modify these terms,
                we will post the modification on the goConnexien.com website, applications, or services,
                which are effective upon posting. By continuing to send referrals after we have
                posted a modification, you are indicating that you agree to be bound by the updated
                terms. If the modified terms are not acceptable to you, your only recourse is to
                stop sending referrals.

                <small class="text-muted">Last revised: March 2017</small>
            </h3>
            <p>
                Our community relies on honest, transparent reviews. We will remove or alter a review
                if we find that it violates our review guidelines.
            </p>
            <h6 class="page-header">
                What are the Connexien review guidelines?
            </h6>
            <p>
                Reviews are your opportunity to build a good reputation in the Connexien community,
                as well as share your experience with the Connexien community. Since you can only
                write a review after a project is completed on the site, you can trust that any
                review you see on a profile page is the result of an actual person working with
                another member of the community.
            </p>
            <p>
                We believe in free speech, transparency, and clear communication. Our community
                is built on trust, and trust comes from honest conversation. Therefore, we ask for
                reviews that are truthful, clear, and helpful to both the review's recipient and
                the wider Connexien community.
            </p>
            <p>
                When creating a review, we ask that you stick to the facts. The best reviews provide
                constructive information that helps the community make better decisions and is educational
                for the business or consultant in question. We strongly discourage personal insults,
                opinion that's not backed up by examples, or generally unsociable behavior.
            </p>
            <p>
                Connexien's default position is not to censor, edit, or delete reviews. However,
                there are rare cases in which we may take the extraordinary step of disallowing
                or removing reviews. We reserve the right to remove reviews that violate our review
                guidelines.
            </p>

                How do reviews work?
            </h6>
            <p>
                All the reviews on Connexien are written by clients and consultants from our community,
                so any review you see is based on a project that was completed on the Connexien
                platform.
            </p>

                Writing a review
            </h6>
            <p>
                To leave feedback for a recent project, visit the feedback tab on the project workspace.
                Reviews are limited to 500 words and must follow Connexien's review guidelines.
            </p>

                Editing a review
            </h6>
            <p>
                After writing a review, if your client or consultant hasn't completed their review
                yet, you can edit your public review until your client or consultant completes their
                review, or until the day window for leaving a review has closed (whichever comes
                first). Your private feedback for the review's recipient and for Connexien are perpetually
                editable. You can edit your review on the feedback tab on the project workspace.
            </p>

                Previous reviews
            </h6>
            <p>
                Past reviews are attached to the project and the public review will be available
                to anyone viewing your profile or the past project details. You will also see any
                Private Feedback that people have left you when you're viewing projects that you
                have worked on.

            <p>
                In addition to written reviews, we ask our users to submit star ratings across several
                different metrics. The number of stars displayed on a user's profile page is an
                average of the scores that different users have given for past projects.
