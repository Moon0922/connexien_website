            <h2>Connexien Contributing Partner Program (CPP)</h2>
            <h4>User Agreement</h4>
            <p>Last revised: June 2018</p>

            <p>THIS USER AGREEMENT (THE "USER AGREEMENT") CONTAINS THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS THAT GOVERN YOUR ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE SERVICES AND IS AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN YOU OR THE BUSINESS YOU REPRESENT AND CONNEXIEN. BY REGISTERING FOR OR USING THE SERVICES, YOU (ON BEHALF OF YOURSELF OR THE BUSINESS YOU REPRESENT) AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING ALL SERVICE TERMS AND PROGRAM POLICIES THAT MAY APPLY.</p>

            <h6>Introduction</h6>
            <p>This Agreement and all policies and additional terms posted on and in our sites, applications, tools and services (collectively "Services") set out the terms on which Connexien offers you access to and use of our Services. Please see our general Terms & Conditions for further details. You agree to comply with all of the terms of this User Agreement when accessing or using our Services.</p>
            <p>The entity you are contracting with is: Connexien LLC, 19100 Von Karman Ave. Suite 950, Irvine, California 92612. In this User Agreement, this entity is individually and collectively referred to as "Connexien," "we," or "us."</p>
            <p><strong>Please be advised that this User Agreement contains provisions that govern how claims you and we have against each other are resolved (see Disclaimer of Warranties; Limitation of Liability and Legal Disputes provisions below). It also contains an Agreement to Arbitrate, which will, with limited exception, require you to submit claims you have against us or our agents to binding and final arbitration, unless you opt out of the Agreement to Arbitrate (see Legal Disputes, Section B ("Agreement to Arbitrate")). Unless you opt out: (1) you will only be permitted to pursue claims against us or our agents on an individual basis, not as a plaintiff or class member in any class or representative action or proceeding and (2) you will only be permitted to seek relief (including monetary, injunctive, and declaratory relief) on an individual basis.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>About Connexien’s Contributing Partner Program (“CPP”)</strong></p>
            <p>Connexien’s CPP is a marketplace/platform that allows content providers to offer and sell their originally authored work products in a variety of pricing formats.</p>
            <p>While we may provide pricing, listing, sourcing, and other guidance in our Services, such guidance is solely informational, and you may decide to follow it or not. Also, while we may help facilitate the resolution of disputes through various programs, we have no control over and do not guarantee: the existence, quality, safety or legality of items advertised; the truth or accuracy of users' content or listings; the ability of sellers to sell items; the ability of buyers to pay for items; or that a buyer or seller will actually complete a transaction or return an item.</p>

            <h6>Using the CPP Platform</h6>

            </ul>

            <p>If we believe you are abusing Connexien and/or our Services in any way, we may, in our sole discretion and without limiting other remedies, limit, suspend, or terminate your user account(s) and access to our Services, delay or remove hosted content, remove any special status associated with your account(s), remove, not display, and/or demote listings, reduce or eliminate any discounts, and take technical and/or legal steps to prevent you from using our Services.</p>
            <p>If we believe you are violating any of Connexien’s policies, you may be subject to a range of actions, including limits on your selling privileges, restrictions on listings and account features, suspension of your account, application of fees, and recovery of expenses for policy monitoring and enforcement. We may cancel unconfirmed accounts or accounts that have been inactive for a long time or modify or discontinue our Services. Additionally, we reserve the right to refuse or terminate all or part of our Services to anyone for any reason at our discretion.</p>
            <h6>Enrollment</h6>
            <p>To begin the enrollment process, you must complete the registration process for one or more of the Services. Use of the Services is limited to parties that can lawfully enter into and form contracts under applicable Law (for example, the Elected Country may not allow minors to use the Services). As part of the application, you must provide us with your (or your business') legal name, address, phone number and e-mail address. We may at any time cease providing any or all of the Services at our sole discretion and without notice.</p>
            <h6>Service Fee Payments; Receipt of Sales Proceeds</h6>
            <p>You are responsible for all of your expenses in connection with this Agreement. To use a Service, you must provide us with valid bank account information for a bank account or bank accounts acceptable by Connexien (conditions for acceptance may be modified or discontinued by us at any time without notice) ("Your Bank Account") and/or a valid credit card information from a credit card or credit cards acceptable by Connexien ("Your Credit Card"). You will use only a name you are authorized to use in connection with a Service and will update all of the information you provide to us in connection with the Services as necessary to ensure that it at all times remains accurate, complete, and valid. You authorize us (and will provide us documentation evidencing your authorization upon our request) to verify your information (including any updated information), to obtain credit reports about you from time to time, to obtain credit authorizations from the issuer of Your Credit Card, and to charge Your Credit Card or debit Your Bank Account for any sums payable by you to us (in reimbursement or otherwise). All payments to you will be remitted to Your Bank Account through a banking network or by other means specified by us.</p>

            <p><strong>If we determine that your actions or performance may result in returns, chargebacks, claims, disputes, violations of our terms or policies, or other risks to Connexien or third parties, then we may in our sole discretion withhold any payments to you for as long as we determine any related risks to Connexien or third parties persist. For any amounts that we determine you owe us, we may (a) charge Your Credit Card or any other payment instrument you provide to us; (b) offset any amounts that are payable by you to us (in reimbursement or otherwise) against any payments we may make to you or amounts we may owe you; (c) invoice you for amounts due to us, in which case you will pay the invoiced amounts upon receipt; (d) reverse any credits to Your Bank Account; or (e) collect payment or reimbursement from you by any other lawful means. If we determine that your account has been used to engage in deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or to repeatedly violate our Policies, then we may in our sole discretion permanently withhold any payments to you.</strong></p>

            <p>In addition, we may require that you pay other amounts to secure the performance of your obligations under this Agreement or to mitigate the risk of returns, chargebacks, claims, disputes, violations of our terms or policies, or other risks to Connexien or third parties. These amounts may be refundable or nonrefundable in the manner we determine, and failure to comply with terms of this Agreement, including any applicable Program Policies, may result in their forfeiture.</p>

            <p>As a security measure, we may, but are not required to, impose transaction limits on some or all customers and sellers relating to the value of any transaction or disbursement, the cumulative value of all transactions or disbursements during a period of time, or the number of transactions per day or other period of time. We will not be liable to you: (i) if we do not proceed with a transaction or disbursement that would exceed any limit established by us for a security reason, or (ii) if we permit a customer to withdraw from a transaction because an Connexien Site or Service is unavailable following the commencement of a transaction.</p>

            <h6>Representations</h6>
            <p>You represent and warrant to us that: (a) if you are a business, you are duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the country in which your business is registered and that you are registering for the Service(s) within such country; (b) you have all requisite right, power, and authority to enter into this Agreement, perform your obligations, and grant the rights, licenses, and authorizations in this Agreement; (c) any information provided or made available by you or your Affiliates to Connexien or its Affiliates is at all times accurate and complete; (d) you and your financial institution(s) are not subject to sanctions or otherwise designated on any list of prohibited or restricted parties or owned or controlled by such a party, including but not limited to the lists maintained by the United Nations Security Council, the US Government (e.g., the US Department of Treasury’s Specially Designated Nationals list and Foreign Sanctions Evaders list and the US Department of Commerce’s Entity List), the European Union or its member states, or other applicable government authority; and (e) you and all of your subcontractors, agents, and suppliers will comply with all applicable Laws in your performance of your obligations and exercise of your rights under this Agreement.</p>
            <h6>Relationship of Parties</h6>
            <p>Under this User Agreement, you and we are independent contractors, and nothing in this Agreement will create any partnership, joint venture, agency, franchise, sales representative, or employment relationship between us. You will have no authority to make or accept any offers or representations on our behalf. This Agreement will not create an exclusive relationship between you and us. Nothing expressed or mentioned in or implied from this Agreement is intended or will be construed to give to any person other than the parties to this Agreement any legal or equitable right, remedy, or claim under or in respect to this Agreement. This Agreement and all of the representations, warranties, covenants, conditions, and provisions in this Agreement are intended to be and are for the sole and exclusive benefit of Connexien, you, and customers. As between you and us, you will be solely responsible for all obligations associated with the use of any third-party service or feature that you permit us to use on your behalf, including compliance with any applicable terms of use. You will not make any statement, whether on your site or otherwise, that would contradict anything in this section.</p>
            <h6>Policy Enforcement</h6>
            <p>When a buyer or seller issue arises, we may consider the user's performance history and the specific circumstances in applying our policies. We may choose to be more lenient with policy enforcement in an effort to do the right thing for both buyers and sellers.</p>
            <h6>Fees</h6>
            <p>The fees we charge for using our Services depend on the item's price. Total fees are calculated as a percentage (30%) of the total amount of the sale. There are no additional fees for shipping and handling as all purchased products are made available in digital download format.  We may change our CPP fees from time to time by posting the changes on the Connexien site 30 days in advance.</p>
            <h6>Listing Conditions</h6>
            <p>When listing an item, you agree to comply with Connexien's listing and selling policies in that:</p>

                <li>Metatags and URL links that are included in a listing may be removed or altered so as to not affect third-party search engine results</li>
                <li>We may provide you with optional recommendations to consider when creating your listings. Such recommendations may be based on the aggregated sales and performance history of similar sold and current listings; results will vary for individual listings.

            </ul>

            </ul>

            <h6>Disclaimer of Warranties; Limitation of Liability</h6>
            <p>We try to keep our Services safe, secure, and functioning properly, but we cannot guarantee the continuous operation of or access to our Services. Such functionality is subject to delays beyond Connexien's control.</p>
            <p>You agree that you are making use of our Services at your own risk, and that they are being provided to you on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis. Accordingly, to the extent permitted by applicable law, we exclude all express or implied warranties, terms and conditions including, but not limited to, implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.</p>
            <p>In addition, to the extent permitted by applicable law, we (including our affiliates and our and their officers, directors, agents and employees) are not liable, and you agree not to hold us responsible, for any damages or losses (including, but not limited to, loss of money, goodwill or reputation, profits, other intangible losses, or any special, indirect, or consequential damages) resulting directly or indirectly from:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>the content you provide (directly or indirectly) using the Services;</li>

            </ul>

In entering into this release you expressly waive any protections (whether statutory or otherwise) that would otherwise limit the coverage of this release to include only those claims which you may know or suspect to exist in your favor at the time of agreeing to this release.</p>
            <h6>Indemnity</h6>
            <p>You will indemnify and hold us (including our affiliates and subsidiaries, as well as our and their respective officers, directors, employees, agents) harmless from any claim or demand, including reasonable legal fees, made by any third party due to or arising out of your breach of our User Agreement, your improper use of Connexien's Services or your breach of any law or the rights of a third party.</p>
            <h6>Legal Disputes</h6>
            <p><strong>PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS AND WILL HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL IMPACT ON HOW CLAIMS YOU AND CONNEXIEN HAVE AGAINST EACH OTHER ARE RESOLVED.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>You and Connexien agree that any claim or dispute at law or equity that has arisen, or may arise, between you and Connexien (including any claim or dispute between you and a third-party agent of Connexien) that relates in any way to or arises out of this or previous versions of this User Agreement, your use of or access to the Services, the actions of Connexien or its agents, or any products or services sold or purchased through the Services, will be resolved in accordance with the provisions set forth in this Legal Disputes Section.</strong></p>
            <h6>Applicable Law</h6>
            <p>You agree that, except to the extent inconsistent with or preempted by federal law, the laws of the State of California, without regard to principles of conflict of laws, will govern this User Agreement and any claim or dispute that has arisen or may arise between you and Connexien, except as otherwise stated in this User Agreement.</p>
            <h6>Agreement to Arbitrate</h6>
            <p><strong>You and Connexien each agree that any and all disputes or claims that have arisen, or may arise, between you and Connexien (including any disputes or claims between you and a third-party agent of Connexien) that relate in any way to or arise out of this or previous versions of the User Agreement, your use of or access to the Services, the actions of Connexien or its agents, or any products or services sold, offered, or purchased through the Services shall be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than in court. Alternatively, you may assert your claims in small claims court, if your claims qualify and so long as the matter remains in such court and advances only on an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Agreement to Arbitrate.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief</strong></p>
            <p><strong>YOU AND CONNEXIEN AGREE THAT EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, OR REPRESENTATIVE OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING. UNLESS BOTH YOU AND CONNEXIEN AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S OR PARTY'S CLAIMS, AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, CLASS, OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING. ALSO, THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY'S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S). ANY RELIEF AWARDED CANNOT AFFECT OTHER USERS. If a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph's limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court, subject to your and Connexien's right to appeal the court's decision. All other claims will be arbitrated.</strong></p>
            <h6>Arbitration Procedures</h6>
            <p>Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, and court review of an arbitration award is very limited. However, an arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual. An arbitrator should apply the terms of the User Agreement as a court would. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to arbitrability, the scope or enforceability of this Agreement to Arbitrate, or the interpretation of Section 1 of this Agreement to Arbitrate ("Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief"), shall be for a court of competent jurisdiction to decide.</p>
            <p>The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") under its rules and procedures, including the AAA's Consumer Arbitration Rules (as applicable), as modified by this Agreement to Arbitrate. The AAA's rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. The use of the word "arbitrator" in this provision shall not be construed to prohibit more than one arbitrator from presiding over an arbitration; rather, the AAA's rules will govern the number of arbitrators that may preside over an arbitration conducted under this Agreement to Arbitrate.</p>
            <p>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a completed Notice of Dispute ("Notice") which should include a description of the nature and basis of the claims the party is asserting, and the relief sought. The Notice to Connexien should be sent to Connexien LLC, Attn: Litigation Department, Re: Notice of Dispute, 19100 Von Karman Ave. Suite 950, Irvine, California 92612. Connexien will send any Notice to you to the physical address we have on file associated with your Connexien account; it is your responsibility to keep your physical address up to date. All information called for in the Notice must be provided, including a description of the nature and basis of the claims the party is asserting and the relief sought.  If you and Connexien are unable to resolve the claims described in the Notice within 30 days after the Notice is sent, you or Connexien may initiate arbitration proceedings. A form for initiating arbitration proceedings is available on the AAA's site at www.adr.org. In addition to filing this form with the AAA in accordance with its rules and procedures, the party initiating the arbitration must mail a copy of the completed form to the opposing party. You may send a copy to Connexien at the following address: Connexien LLC, 19100 Von Karman Ave. Suite 950, Irvine, California 92612. In the event Connexien initiates an arbitration against you, it will send a copy of the completed Notice to the physical address we have on file associated with your Connexien account. Any settlement offer made by you or Connexien shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator.</p>
            <p>The arbitration hearing shall be held in the county in which you reside or at another mutually agreed location. If the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, you or Connexien may elect to have the arbitration conducted by telephone or based solely on written submissions, which election shall be binding on you and Connexien subject to the arbitrator's discretion to require an in-person hearing, if the circumstances warrant. In cases where an in-person hearing is held, you and/or Connexien may attend by telephone, unless the arbitrator requires otherwise.</p>
            <p>The arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with applicable law, including recognized principles of equity, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law. The arbitrator shall not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving different users but is bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same Connexien user to the extent required by applicable law. The arbitrator's award shall be final and binding and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.</p>
            <h6>Costs of Arbitration</h6>
            <p>Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules, unless otherwise stated in this Agreement to Arbitrate. If (a) you willfully fail to comply with the Notice of Dispute requirement discussed above, or (b) in the event the arbitrator determines the claim(s) you assert in the arbitration to be frivolous, you agree to reimburse Connexien for all fees associated with the arbitration paid by Connexien on your behalf that you otherwise would be obligated to pay under the AAA's rules.</p>
            <h6>Severability</h6>
            <p>With the exception of any of the provisions in Section 1 of this Agreement to Arbitrate ("Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief"), if an arbitrator or court decides that any part of this Agreement to Arbitrate is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of this Agreement to Arbitrate shall still apply.</p>
